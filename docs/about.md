Hi there! Thank you for stopping by my page!

My name is Adesemi Elumaro but my friends call me **Dese** (pronounced day-shay)! I was born here in the United States but have grown up in Nigeria (my home country), England, and India!

I am currently a junior at Duke University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Economics and Theater Studies! I am really interested in exploring how the intersection of technology, education, and business can help Nigeria and other developing countries play a larger role in the global economy!

You can learn more about what organizations I'm involved with, my hobbies, etc. from my resume [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Zt1bIpjW0Er3GWj1aiM71Eu-W-UOqyd/view?usp=sharing)

Let's talk about how we can make the world a better place! I am currently in Durham, NC.
